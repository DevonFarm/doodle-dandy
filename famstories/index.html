<p>FIVE Stars... Susan changed my life with such an amazing pup. And thank you Chip and PZ for bringing Blitzen into this world. Susan's family went above and beyond ~ her son and friend drove Blitzen all the way to IL. I can tell her family raises their pups with a lot of love and attention. When we met Blitzen (3 mo. old) he would rest his nose on my nose and lock eyes the whole ride. Soon as we brought him home he would not stop with kisses :) Also ran through a tunnel (for agility training) without any training! Cannot wait to have fun with him and watch him grow. Susan included a gift bag that was perfect for the ride home (Blitzen loves sleeping on the cooling pad that has his mom's scent). We noticed my sister's dog was not shaking in the car for the first time because Blitzen was a role model - very calm in the car. They look like father and son, and are starting to mimic each other. Very grateful to Susan for this beautiful pup. When I wake up next to him and his "blizzard" hair I'm so grateful..</p>
